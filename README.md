# Automation-Excel

In this fun little project I wanted to practice automating big repetitive tasks using Python. I created a program with a reusable function for processing spreadsheets. In the presented examples I used it to correct all of the prices by decreasing them by 50%.

The prices before the corrections:
[transactions.xlsx](https://github.com/cerovina/Automation-Excel/files/9035586/transactions.xlsx)

The prices after the corrections:
[corrected_transactions.xlsx](https://github.com/cerovina/Automation-Excel/files/9035587/corrected_transactions.xlsx)
